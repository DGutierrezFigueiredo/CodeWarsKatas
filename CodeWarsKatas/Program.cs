    ----------------------------------------List of Kata's descriptions------------------------------------------------------


 ------------------------------>AbbreviateATwoWordNameRegexKata:

 Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

 The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

 It should look like this:

 Sam Harris => S.H

 patrick feeney => P.F


------------------------------>ArrayDiffKata:

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

Kata.ArrayDiff(new int[] {1, 2}, new int[] {1}) => new int[] {2}
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

Kata.ArrayDiff(new int[] {1, 2, 2, 2, 3}, new int[] {2}) => new int[] {1, 3}


------------------------------>BestMatchKata:

"AL-AHLY" and "Zamalek" are the best teams in Egypt, but "AL-AHLY" always wins the matches between them. "Zamalek" managers want to know what is the best match they've played so far.

The best match is the match they lost with the minimum goal difference. If there is more than one match with the same difference, choose the one "Zamalek" scored more goals in.

Given the information about all matches they played, return the index of the best match (0-based). If more than one valid result, return the smallest index.

Example
For ALAHLYGoals = [6,4] and zamalekGoals = [1,2], the output should be 1.

Because 4 - 2 is less than 6 - 1

For ALAHLYGoals = [1,2,3,4,5] and zamalekGoals = [0,1,2,3,4], the output should be 4.

The goal difference of all matches are 1, but at 4th match "Zamalek" scored more goals in. So the result is 4.

Input/Output
[input] integer array ALAHLYGoals
The number of goals "AL-AHLY" scored in each match.

[input] integer array zamalekGoals
The number of goals "Zamalek" scored in each match. It is guaranteed that zamalekGoals[i] < ALAHLYGoals[i] for each element.

[output] an integer
Index of the best match.

------------------------------>BreakCamelCaseKata:

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

Example
"camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
"identifier"   =>  "identifier"
""             =>  ""

------------------------------>BuyingACarKata:

Let us begin with an example:

A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.

He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month. Furthermore this percent of loss increases of 0.5 percent at the end of every two months. Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.

Can you help him?

How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and how much money will he have left over?

Parameters and return of function:

parameter (positive int or float, guaranteed) startPriceOld (Old car price)
parameter (positive int or float, guaranteed) startPriceNew (New car price)
parameter (positive int or float, guaranteed) savingperMonth 
parameter (positive float or int, guaranteed) percentLossByMonth

nbMonths(2000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [6, 766] or (6, 766)
Detail of the above example:
end month 1: percentLoss 1.5 available -4910.0
end month 2: percentLoss 2.0 available -3791.7999...
end month 3: percentLoss 2.0 available -2675.964
end month 4: percentLoss 2.5 available -1534.06489...
end month 5: percentLoss 2.5 available -395.71327...
end month 6: percentLoss 3.0 available 766.158120825...
return [6, 766] or (6, 766)
where 6 is the number of months at the end of which he can buy the new car and 766 is the nearest integer to 766.158... (rounding 766.158 gives 766).

Note:

Selling, buying and saving are normally done at end of month. Calculations are processed at the end of each considered month but if, by chance from the start, the value of the old car is bigger than the value of the new one or equal there is no saving to be made, no need to wait so he can at the beginning of the month buy the new car:

nbMonths(12000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [0, 4000]
nbMonths(8000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [0, 0]
We don't take care of a deposit of savings in a bank:-)

------------------------------>CockroachSpeedKata:

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

1.08 ==> 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

------------------------------>EvenOrOddKata:

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

------------------------------>FindTheStrayNumberKata:

You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

The input array will always be valid! (odd-length >= 3)

Examples
[1, 1, 2] ==> 2
[17, 17, 3, 17, 17, 17, 17] ==> 3

------------------------------>FoldAnArrayKata:

In this kata you have to write a method that folds a given array of integers by the middle x-times.

An example says more than thousand words:

Fold 1-times:
[1,2,3,4,5] ------------------------------> [6,6,3]

A little visualization (NOT for the algorithm but for the idea of folding):

 Step 1         Step 2        Step 3       Step 4       Step5
                     5/           5|         5\          
                    4/            4|          4\      
1 2 3 4 5      1 2 3/         1 2 3|       1 2 3\       6 6 3
----*----      ----*          ----*        ----*        ----*


Fold 2-times:
[1,2,3,4,5] ------------------------------> [9,6]
As you see, if the count of numbers is odd, the middle number will stay. Otherwise the fold-point is between the middle-numbers, so all numbers would be added in a way.

The array will always contain numbers and will never be null. The parameter runs will always be a positive integer greater than 0 and says how many runs of folding your method has to do.

If an array with one element is folded, it stays as the same array.

The input array should not be modified!

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.

------------------------------>HighestAndLowestKata:

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
Kata.HighAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
Kata.HighAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
Kata.HighAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

------------------------------>IntegerDifferenceKata

Write a function that accepts two arguments: an array/list of integers and another integer (n).

Determine the number of times where two integers in the array have a difference of n.

For example:

[1, 1, 5, 6, 9, 16, 27], n=4  ------------------------------->  3  # (1,5), (1,5), (5,9)
[1, 1, 3, 3], n=2             ------------------------------->  4  # (1,3), (1,3), (1,3), (1,3)

------------------------------>IQTestKata

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers 
differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. 
Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, 
and return a position of this number.

Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

Examples :
iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd


------------------------------>IsChangePossiblePeopleInLineKata

The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. 
Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the 
order people follow in the line?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. 
Otherwise return NO.

------------------------------>IsThatATriangleKata

Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with 
the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

------------------------------>MakeUpperCaseKata

Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

------------------------------>MovingZeroesToTheEndKata

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

Kata.MoveZeroes(new int[] {1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1}) => new int[] {1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0}

------------------------------>MultiplicationTableKata

Your task, is to create NxN multiplication table, of size provided in parameter.

for example, when given size is 3:

1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
for given example, the return value should be: [[1,2,3],[2,4,6],[3,6,9]]

------------------------------>NotVerySecureRegexKata

In this example you have to validate if a user input string is alphanumeric. The given string is not nil/null/NULL/None, so you don't have to check that.

The string has the following conditions to be alphanumeric:

At least one character ("" is not valid)
Allowed characters are uppercase / lowercase latin letters and digits from 0 to 9
No whitespaces / underscore

------------------------------>OppositesAttractKata

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if 
they aren't.

------------------------------>PersistentBuggerKata

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example (Input -------------------------------> Output):

39 ==> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
999 ==> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
4 ==> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)

------------------------------>ShortLongShortKata

Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the 
longer string on the inside. The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty ( zero length ).

The length of string is not always the same as the number of characters
For example: (Input1, Input2) ==> output

("1", "22") ==> "1221"
("22", "1") ==> "1221"

------------------------------>SortTheOddKata

You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers 
at their original positions.

Examples
[7, 1]  =>  [1, 7]
[5, 8, 6, 3, 4]  =>  [3, 8, 6, 5, 4]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  =>  [1, 8, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 0]

------------------------------>StringEndsWithKata

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Examples:

solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false

------------------------------>SudokuSolutionValidatorKata

Sudoku Background
Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill all cells of the grid with digits from 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as blocks) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
(More info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

Sudoku Solution Validator
Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() that accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.

The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains integers from 0 to 9.

Examples
validSolution([
  [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2],
  [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8],
  [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7],
  [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3],
  [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
  [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
  [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4],
  [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
  [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9]
]); // => true
validSolution([
  [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2], 
  [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 0, 3, 4, 8],
  [1, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 0],
  [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 0, 2, 0],
  [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
  [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
  [9, 0, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1, 4],
  [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
  [3, 0, 0, 4, 8, 1, 1, 7, 9]
]); // => false

------------------------------>SumOfPositivesKata

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

------------------------------>TheIfFunction

Create a function called _if which takes 3 arguments: a boolean value bool and 2 functions (which do not take any parameters): func1 and func2

When bool is truth-ish, func1 should be called, otherwise call the func2.

Example:
Kata.If(true, () => Console.WriteLine("True"), () => Console.WriteLine("False"));
// write "True" to console

------------------------------>TicTacToeValidationKata

If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? 
Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", 
or 2 if it is an "O", like so:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 0]]
We want our function to return:

-1 if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
1 if "X" won,
2 if "O" won,
0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).
You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

------------------------------>TitleCaseKata

A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is either (a) capitalised (that is, only the first 
letter of the word is in upper case) or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into lower case unless it is 
the first word, which is always capitalised.

Write a function that will convert a string into title case, given an optional list of exceptions (minor words). 
The list of minor words will be given as a string with each word separated by a space. Your function should ignore the 
case of the minor words string -- it should behave in the same way even if the case of the minor word string is changed.

###Arguments (Other languages)

First argument (required): the original string to be converted.
Second argument (optional): space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase except for the first word in 
the string. The JavaScript/CoffeeScript tests will pass undefined when this argument is unused.
###Example

Kata.TitleCase("a clash of KINGS", "a an the of")   => "A Clash of Kings"
Kata.TitleCase("THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS", "The In") => "The Wind in the Willows"
Kata.TitleCase("the quick brown fox")               => "The Quick Brown Fox"

------------------------------>TowerBuilderKata

Build Tower
Build Tower by the following given argument:
number of floors (integer and always greater than 0).

Tower block is represented as *

Python: return a list;
JavaScript: returns an Array;
C#: returns a string[];
PHP: returns an array;
C++: returns a vector<string>;
Haskell: returns a [String];
Ruby: returns an Array;
Lua: returns a Table;
Have fun!

for example, a tower of 3 floors looks like below

[
  '  *  ', 
  ' *** ', 
  '*****'
]
and a tower of 6 floors looks like below

[
  '     *     ', 
  '    ***    ', 
  '   *****   ', 
  '  *******  ', 
  ' ********* ', 
  '***********'
]

------------------------------>TwiceAsOldKata

Your function takes two arguments:

current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Сalculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

------------------------------>TwiceLinearKata

Consider a sequence u where u is defined as follows:

The number u(0) = 1 is the first one in u.
For each x in u, then y = 2 * x + 1 and z = 3 * x + 1 must be in u too.
There are no other numbers in u.
Ex: u = [1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 27, ...]

1 gives 3 and 4, then 3 gives 7 and 10, 4 gives 9 and 13, then 7 gives 15 and 22 and so on...

Task:
Given parameter n the function dbl_linear (or dblLinear...) returns the element u(n) of the ordered (with <) sequence u 
(so, there are no duplicates).

Example:
dbl_linear(10) should return 22

Note:
Focus attention on efficiency

------------------------------>WhatIsBetweenKata

Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:

a = 1
b = 4
==> [1, 2, 3, 4]

------------------------------>WorkOnStringsKata

Your task is to Combine two Strings. But consider the rule...

By the way you don't have to check errors or incorrect input values, everything is ok without bad tricks, only two input 
strings and as result one output string;-)...

And here's the rule:
Input Strings a and b: For every character in string a swap the casing of every occurrence of the same character in 
string b. Then do the same casing swap with the inputs reversed. Return a single string consisting of the changed 
version of a followed by the changed version of b. A char of a is in b regardless if it's in upper or lower case - 
see the testcases too.
I think that's all;-)...

Some easy examples:

Input: "abc" and "cde"      => Output: "abCCde" 
Input: "ab" and "aba"       => Output: "aBABA"
Input: "abab" and "bababa"  => Output: "ABABbababa"
Once again for the last example - description from KenKamau, see discourse;-):

a) swap the case of characters in string b for every occurrence of that character in string a
char 'a' occurs twice in string a, so we swap all 'a' in string b twice. This means we start with "bababa" then "bAbAbA" => "bababa"
char 'b' occurs twice in string a and so string b moves as follows: start with "bababa" then "BaBaBa" => "bababa"

b) then, swap the case of characters in string a for every occurrence in string b
char 'a' occurs 3 times in string b. So string a swaps cases as follows: start with "abab" then => "AbAb" => "abab" => "AbAb"
char 'b' occurs 3 times in string b. So string a swaps as follow: start with "AbAb" then => "ABAB" => "AbAb" => "ABAB".

c) merge new strings a and b
return "ABABbababa"

There are some static tests at the beginning and many random tests if you submit your solution.

Hope you have fun:-)!

------------------------------>YouOnlyNeedOneKata

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.
